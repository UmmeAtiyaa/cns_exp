4. nslookup
The nslookup command is used to query DNS to obtain domain name or IP address mapping.

Summary of Commands
Hereâ€™s a summary of the commands used:

WHOIS: Retrieves domain registration details.
bash
Copy code
whois example.com
dig: Queries DNS records.
bash
Copy code
dig example.com          # A record
dig example.com MX       # MX record
traceroute: Traces the route to a network host.
bash
Copy code
traceroute example.com
nslookup: Queries DNS for domain name resolution.
bash
Copy code
nslookup example.com
nslookup -query=MX example.com  # MX record

Replace example.com with the actual domain name you want to query.
Some commands may require administrative privileges, especially traceroute on certain systems. You can prefix with sudo if necessary.
These commands are typically available on Unix/Linux systems. On Windows, you can use tracert instead of traceroute, and nslookup works similarly. The whois and dig commands may need to be installed separately on Windows.
