1. Show Active Nodes
To discover active hosts on a network (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24), you can use the following command:

bash
Copy code
nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24
-sn: This option tells Nmap to perform a "ping scan" to discover hosts without performing a port scan.
2. Show Open Ports
To scan for open ports on a specific host (e.g., 192.168.1.10), use the following command:

bash
Copy code
nmap -sT 192.168.1.10
-sT: This option performs a TCP connect scan, which attempts to connect to open ports.
3. OS Fingerprinting
To determine the operating system of a target host (e.g., 192.168.1.10), use the following command:

bash
Copy code
nmap -O 192.168.1.10
-O: This option enables OS detection.
4. Ping Scan
To perform a ping scan on a network to discover active hosts, use:

bash
Copy code
nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24
This is the same command as for showing active nodes. It performs a ping scan to determine which hosts are up.
5. TCP Port Scan
To perform a TCP scan on a specific host (e.g., 192.168.1.10), you can use:

bash
Copy code
nmap -sS 192.168.1.10
-sS: This option performs a stealth SYN scan, which is less likely to be detected by firewalls and intrusion detection systems.
Example Usage
Here's how you might use these commands in sequence:

Discover active nodes:
bash
Copy code
nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24
Check for open ports on a specific host:
bash
Copy code
nmap -sT 192.168.1.10
Perform OS fingerprinting:
bash
Copy code
nmap -O 192.168.1.10
(Optional) Conduct a TCP port scan:
bash
Copy code
nmap -sS 192.168.1.10
Notes
Make sure you have the necessary permissions to scan the network or devices, as unauthorized scanning can be illegal and against network policies.
You might need to run these commands with sudo for proper access, depending on your system's configuration. For example, use sudo nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24 if you encounter permission issues.
